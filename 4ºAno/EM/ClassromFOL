/**
 * First-order logic revision exercises based on a simple model of a 
 * classroom management system.
 * 
 * The model has 5 unary predicates (sets), Person, Student, Teacher,
 * Group and Class, Student and Teacher a sub-set of Person. There are 
 * two binary predicates, Tutors a sub-set of Person x Person, and 
 * Teaches a sub-set of Person x Teaches. There is also a ternary 
 * predicate Groups, sub-set of Class x Person x Group.
 *
 * Solve the following exercises using only Alloy's first-order 
 * logic:
 *	- terms 't' are variables
 *	- atomic formulas are either term comparisons 't1 = t2' and 
 * 't1 != t2' or n-ary predicate tests 't1 -> ... -> tn in P' and 
 * 't1 -> ... -> tn not in P'
 *	- formulas are composed by 
 *		- Boolean connectives 'not', 'and', 'or' and 'implies'
 *		- quantifications 'all' and 'some' over unary predicates
